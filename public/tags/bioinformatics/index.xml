      <description>Python is a powerful program to biologists who work with DNA sequencing. Sequence alignment is one use to scientists. Global and local alignment can be done through Smith Waterman algorithm and Needleman-Wunsch. In addition, BLAST, a popular method among gentists, can be performed in python.
Subsequences of DNA are often reffered to as k-mers, which can be broken down and counted through a function. For this demonstration k will be equal to 3, to account for codons in a sequence.</description>
